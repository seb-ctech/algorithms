# Computational Thinking

- Computational thinking is a approach to problem solving that does not only apply to computer science

### Decomposition

- breaking a complex problem down into sub-problems and repeat the process indefinetely in a recursive fascion
- recompose the sub problems together to solve the complex problem

### Pattern Recognition

- Finding similarities or shared characteristics between problems to apply same solution

### Abstraction

- Determining what characteristics of the problem are important filtering out the less important ones
- Use them to create a representation of what we are trying to solve

### Algorithms

- A step-by-step instruction of how to solve a problem
- Identifies what is to be done, and the order in which it should be done
- Can be described as a flow chart for humans to read


## Algorithms

#### Finding the Maximum Value

- At first set the max to the first value
- Then compare each next value with the current max
- If the compared value is bigger than the current max, the new value becomes the max
- Repeat for all other values

This is necessary because in computation we have the limitation of one binary operation at a time.

x = 31
y = 8
